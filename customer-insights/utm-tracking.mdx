title: 'UTM Tracking'
description: 'Understand where your campaign traffic is coming from.'

Moongate supports UTM tracking. UTM tracking is enabled by appending `?utm_(anything-you-want-to-track)=(anything)` to the back of your campaign's URL. 
Multiple parameters can be tracked at the same time; simply add `&utm_(anything-you-want-to-track)=(anything)` after the first 
UTM parameter. Typical values for the '(anything-you-want-to-track)' fields include source, medium, campaign, term, and content. 

For instance, you could distribute a link to your event via Instagram with the UTM parameter `?utm_source=instagram` (where 
`(anything-you-want-to-track) = source` and `(anything) = instagram`) in the URL, enabling you to view which ticket transactions
originated from Instagram. An example URL would be formatted as follows: https://app.moongate.id/events/moongatedemo?utm_source=instagram

Clicking on an individual transaction from the portal displays the UTM data associated with that transaction, if any. UTM data is 
also visible within the corresponding CSV export.
