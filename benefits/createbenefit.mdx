    <Info>
        Moongate automatically generates a placeholder benefit titled "Reward 1". A benefit campaign must have at least one benefit associated with it, so feel free to delete this placeholder benefit after creating a benefit of your own.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add benefit name">
    Enter the name of this benefit. Additional benefits can always be added to the campaign later.

    <Tip>
            Set the price to 0 if the membership tier is free to join.

    <Tip>
            To change the currency type, return to "① Info" in the sidebar and change the value in the "Currency" field.

  <Step title="Gate benefit by NFT">
    <Info>
        Unlike tickets or membership passes, benefits **must** be gated by NFT ownership (including prior events ticketed by/membership programs
        administered by Moongate). Please refer to [this guide](/benefits/gating) for instructions on gating by NFT.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify advanced options (optional)">
    If applicable, specify advanced options such as limited quantity, whether users can redeem the benefit multiple times, whether users must
    hold a promo code to unlock this benefit, etc.

  <Step title="Add questions (optional)">
    <img src= "/images/benefits/create-benefit/add Qs.gif"/>
    If desired, add questions to collect information from users who are joining your benefit campaign. These questions 
    will be shown to users during checkout.

    Responses can be viewed from the benefit campaign's Sales tab, located in the campaign's dashboard.

  <Step title="Specify payment options">
    Select a payment option if applicable. Moongate supports credit cards, crypto, and PayPal. **You will not automatically receive payouts, so please contact us if you will be collecting payment for your benefit campaign.**
