    <Info>
        Moongate automatically generates a placeholder benefit titled "Reward 1" upon the creation of a campaign. A benefit campaign must have at least one benefit associated with it, so feel free to delete this placeholder benefit after creating a benefit of your own.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add benefit name">
    Enter the name of this benefit. Additional benefits can always be added to the campaign later.
