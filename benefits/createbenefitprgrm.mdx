In order to create and distribute a benefit, you must first create an associated benefit campaign.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your benefit campaign">
      Sign into the [Moongate Merchant Portal](https://portal.moongate.id/), open the ['Benefit' tab](https://portal.moongate.id/benefits), and click 'Create'.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add basic benefit campaign information">
    Enter the title of the benefit campaign, the URL, your description and featured image for the campaign, claiming period, currency used to purchase premium benefits (if any), and information about your brand.

    </Frame>
    <Warning>
        While you can edit most of this information even after the campaign is activated,
        your campaign's URL **cannot be changed after publication.** Be sure to double-check it
        before activation.
    </Warning>
    When you are ready, scroll to the end of the page and click 'Next'.
    
    Your benefit campaign has not yet been launched yet! You'll have to [create a benefit](/benefits/createbenefit) first.
    <Tip>
        Tip: Clicking "Next" will save your work. You can also click "Save Draft" at any point
        to save your work and return to it later.
