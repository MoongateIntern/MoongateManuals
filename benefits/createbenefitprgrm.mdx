    </Frame>
    <Warning>
        While you can edit most of this information even after the campaign is activated,
        your campaign's URL **cannot be changed after publication.** Be sure to double-check it
        before activation.
    </Warning>
    When you are ready, scroll to the end of the page and click 'Next'.
    
    Your benefit campaign has not yet been launched yet! You'll have to [create a benefit](/benefits/createbenefit) first.

        Tip: Clicking "Next" will save your work. You can also click "Save Draft" at any point
        to save your work and return to it later.
