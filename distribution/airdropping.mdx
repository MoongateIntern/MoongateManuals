</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign into the Moongate Merchant Portal">
        [https://portal.moongate.id/](https://portal.moongate.id/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to the target event or membership page">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose the ticket type or membership tier to be airdropped">
        Go to the "③ Tickets" or "③ Tiers" page within the chosen event/membership page respectively, and locate the ticket type or membership tier that you want to airdrop.
        
        Please note that airdropping a ticket/membership enables the recipient(s) to claim it for free, regardless of whether the ticket/membership is paid or not. If your application still requires recipients to pay, we recommend gating by NFT/Email/Wallet instead.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose an email input method">
        Click the "Airdrop" button on the target ticket type/membership tier.
        
        Select "Upload .CSV" if there are a large number of people that you will be airdropping the ticket/membership to, and "Manual" for a smaller quantity.
