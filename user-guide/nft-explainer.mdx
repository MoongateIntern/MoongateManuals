We've taken great care to abstract away most of the complexities of Web3 on Moongate in order to make things easier to understand. 
But just in case you're curious, we've explained some basic Web3 terms below for your reference. Please feel free to skip this section 
though – you truly don't need to know much about Web3 in order to get the most out of Moongate.

**Blockchain:** a decentralized and transparent public digital ledger. Think of a blockchain as a very large public spreadsheet that tracks 
the history of all of its contents.

**NFT:** think of an NFT as a cell in that very large public spreadsheet. That cell can hold anything – pictures, videos, or in Moongate's 
case, tickets and memberships.

**Wallet:** part of the information contained within an NFT is a reference that denotes its owner. If an NFT is a PO box, then wallets 
are the address of the owner associated with them. Moongate automatically creates a wallet for you to use, but you can connect an 
existing one if you'd like.

**Gas Fee:** the fee paid for making a transaction on the blockchain. If you sell or transfer your ticket to somebody else, you will have to 
pay a nominal gas fee.

**Soulbound:** while a regular NFT can be traded between anybody with a crypto wallet, soulbound NFTs cannot be traded. Soulbound status is 
declared when an NFT is first created, so an existing NFT cannot swap between soulbound or non-soulbound status.
