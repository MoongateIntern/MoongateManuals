## V. Referral Program: Build your Farmer Network
Sharing is caring‚Ä¶and earning! Spread the word about MoonFarmer and earn points with every new MoonFarmer who joins through your referral link. 

Go to the profile tab, copy your unique link, and send it to friends and family (your Farmer network). On top of a one-off point reward, you earn 15% of your direct referral‚Äôs points, and 5% of your referral‚Äôs referrals points. 

So, simply said, refer more friends for more points.

## VI. Multiplier: Ramp up with PowerUps
You can also get PowerUps to get a multiplier event on your points. You can unlock the PowerUps either by gaining enough points or purchasing it. 

For a limited time, we will keep the lowest tier for free to claim. 

The PowerUps are limited in volume, so be sure to get your PowerUps while supplies last!
