            <Warning>
                **If you are purchasing ticket(s) on behalf of someone else, please enable the "Buy for others" toggle and provide their email 
                address.**
                
                Due to the nature of NFTs and the blockchain, transferring a ticket(s) from your account to theirs at a later time 
                will incur a transfer fee. Providing their email address during this step will bypass this fee.
