The [Moongate Portal](https://app.moongate.id) is your key point of interaction with Moongate. From here, you can view your tickets/membership passes, obtain the check-in QR code for your event(s), redeem benefits, and manage your account.

From the '[Pass](https://app.moongate.id)' page, you can view all of your tickets and membership passes. Tickets for past events will still remain visible in this view as they may unlock future benefits.
