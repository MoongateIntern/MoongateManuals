## I. Refund Policy
### A. General Refund Guidelines
    1. **No Standard Refunds:** Given that tickets are issued in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), we generally advise event organizers to specify that events do not support refunds.
    2. **Manual Refund Process:** In exceptional circumstances where a refund is deemed necessary, we can facilitate this on a manual basis.
### B. Refund Request Procedure
    1. **Initiating a Refund:** Either event organizers or ticket purchasers can initiate a refund request by submitting relevant details to our support team.
    2. **Verification:** Our team will verify the details and circumstances of the refund request before processing.
### C. Refund Amounts
    1. **Standard Refund:** The standard refund amount will be the ticket price minus the payment processing fee, as payment processing fees from platforms like Stripe or CoinGate are non-refundable.
    2. **Full Refund:** We can facilitate a full refund, inclusive of the payment processing fee, under special circumstances. However, the cost of the payment processing fee will then be transferred to the event organizer.
