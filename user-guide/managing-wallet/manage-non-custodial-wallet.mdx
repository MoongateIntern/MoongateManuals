<Info>
    This guide is intended for users whose wallets are the non-custodial variety automatically created by Moongate. If you are 
    using your own wallet to receive tickets/memberships from Moongate, please refer to your wallet provider's documentation.
</Info>
<Warning>
    Moongate has partnered with Particle Wallet to create non-custodial wallets. As such, Moongate has no administrative control over your wallet and its contents, and as such is unable to manage your wallet on your behalf. 
    We recommend contacting [Particle Wallet support](https://discord.com/invite/FB44yXKnRK) if you require additional support.
