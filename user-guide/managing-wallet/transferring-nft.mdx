<Info>
    This guide is intended for users whose wallets are the non-custodial variety automatically created by Moongate. If you are 
    using your own wallet to receive tickets/memberships from Moongate, please refer to your wallet provider's documentation for 
    information on conducting transfers.
</Info>
<Warning>
    **Please note:** Moongate has no administrative control over your wallet and its contents, and as such is unable to facilitate any 
    transfers on your behalf.

    <Step title="Select the NFT you wish to transfer">

        <Info>
            If your asset value = $0, you'll need to top it up with credits to cover the transfer fee. You can do this by clicking "Buy" 
            and purchasing credits using a credit/debit card, or transferring funds from another wallet.
            
            **NOTE:** the minimum credit 
            purchase amount will likely be higher than the transfer fee.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
        Confirm and sign the transaction. The gas fee will be deducted from your account and the NFT will then be transferred to the 
        specified address. Please note that the transaction may take some time to process due to blockchain confirmation times.
