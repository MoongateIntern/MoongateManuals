<Warning>
    **Please note:** Moongate has no administrative control over your wallet and its contents, and as such is unable to facilitate any 
    transfers on your behalf.
</Warning>
<Info>
    This guide is intended for users whose wallets are the non-custodial variety automatically created by Moongate. If you are 
    using your own wallet to receive tickets/memberships from Moongate, please refer to your wallet provider's documentation for 
    information on conducting NFT transfers. We've attached the documentation for several popular wallet providers below.

<Info>
    If you have received an NFT ticket/membership pass for a campaign administered by Moongate in an external wallet but **do not have a Moongate account**, follow [these instructions](/user-guide/the-basics/signup-login)
    to create a Moongate account connected to your existing wallet. Once connected, your NFT ticket/membership pass should be displayed on Moongate and [check-in functionality](/user-guide/the-basics/user-check-in-guide) should work as expected.

        <Info>
            If your asset value = $0, you'll need to top it up with credits to cover the transfer fee. You can do this by clicking "Buy" 
            and purchasing credits using a credit/debit card, or transferring funds from another wallet.
            
            **NOTE:** the minimum credit purchase amount will likely be higher than the transfer fee.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Confirm the transaction">
        Confirm and sign the transaction. The gas fee will be deducted from your account and the NFT will then be transferred to the 
        specified address. Please note that the transaction may take some time to process due to blockchain confirmation times.
