title: 'Manually Adding an NFT'
---
<Tip>If you purchased a ticket/membership pass NFT directly from Moongate and sent it to your external wallet during the check-out process, 
they will still be available on Moongate's portal even if you do not manually add the NFT to your wallet. This ensures a smooth check-in process.
</Tip>

If you're using an external wallet with Moongate, you'll likely need to manually import your NFTs to your wallet in order to view them. 

<Steps>
    
    <Step title="Find your NFT's details on OpenSea">
        You can find your NFT's details (contract address and unique token ID) on your NFT's OpenSea view, which can be accessed by clicking the 'Marketplace' 
        button under your NFT ticket/pass on the Moongate portal.
