<Tip>Even if you do not manually add a ticket/membership pass NFT to your wallet, they will still be detected on Moongate's portal in order to ensure a smooth check-in process.)</Tip>

If you're using an external wallet with Moongate, you'll likely need to manually import your NFTs to your wallet in order to view them there. 

Afterwards, you'll need to manually manually import the NFT. Please refer to your wallet provider's documentation for instructions on how to manually 
import an NFT. You can find your NFT's details (contract address and unique token ID) on your NFT's OpenSea view, which can be accessed by clicking the 'Marketplace' 
button under your NFT ticket/pass on the Moongate portal.
