    <Accordion title="Do I need an existing blockchain wallet to make a purchase on Moongate?">
        No, you don't! When you create a Moongate account via Google or email, Moongate automatically creates a non-custodial wallet for you. You can 
        manage this wallet under the '[Profile](https://app.moongate.id/profile)' page on our user web portal.
        
        Web3 users with existing wallets creating their Moongate account for the first time can link their wallet both during and after the account creation process. Refer to [our guide](/user-guide/managing-wallet/connecting-wallet) for more information on how to do so.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I don't recognise the wallet address at the checkout page.">
        When you log in using Google or email, we automatically create a non-custodial wallet for you. The wallet address that you do not recognize is likely the address of this non-custodial wallet.
        
        If you would prefer to receive the NFT in your own external wallet, you have two options:
        1. Create a new account using your own wallet ‚Äì more information on that under the 'Existing Wallet' tab [here](/user-guide/the-basics/signup-login).
        2. [Connect your wallet to your existing Moongate account](/user-guide/managing-wallet/connecting-wallet). After connecting your wallet you'll be able to choose your own wallet during check out.

    <Accordion title="I'm stuck on an error page after clicking 'Sign in to Moongate' in the email.">
        Please ensure that you have not blocked the pop-up window when you clicked the "Sign in to Moongate" link. You should see a pop-up window that requires you to click "Approve" before you can proceed.

        Additionally, make sure that you are not browsing in Incognito mode.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I bought a ticket/membership via Moongate. Where is my ticket/membership?">
        Your ticket or membership is stored as an NFT in your blockchain wallet. You can check your NFT at our [user web portal](https://app.moongate.id). The ‚ÄúPass‚Äù section shows all the tickets/memberships you have acquired using the Moongate platform.
        
        If you received your ticket/membership NFT in your own external wallet, please follow our guide [here](/user-guide/managing-wallet/manually-add-nft) 
        on how to manually add it to your wallet. Otherwise, your ticket/membership NFT will be in your [automatically created wallet](/user-guide/managing-wallet/manage-non-custodial-wallet).     
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I purchased a ticket administered by Moongate on the secondary market. How will my ticket be authenticated?">
        Assuming the wallet containing your newly purchased ticket is connected to your Moongate account, you can follow our [check-in guide](/user-guide/the-basics/user-check-in-guide) as usual to successfully check into the event.

        The QR code sent to the original purchaser's email will be automatically invalidated upon transfer, meaning that you don't have to worry about potential duplicate tickets.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I can't see my NFT ticket/membership at the user portal.">
        Please ensure that you are logged in with the same account that you used to purchase the NFT tickets. If you continue to experience issues, please 
        [contact us](mailto:support@moongate.id).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I can't see my NFT ticket/membership in my wallet.">
        There are a number of common reasons that this may occur.
        <Steps>
            <Step title="You are checking a wallet which you haven't connected to Moongate.">
                This is often the case if you signed up to Moongate using email or Google login, as we automatically create a non-custodial wallet for users who sign up via these methods. 
                To view your NFT in your non-custodial wallet, please refer to the [instructions here](/user-guide/managing-wallet/manage-non-custodial-wallet).
            </Step>
            <Step title="You haven't configured your wallet to display NFTs on the same chain that the NFT ticket/membership is deployed on.">
                Moongate often deploys on the Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and XLayer chains, so try adding those. We recommend referring to your wallet
                provider's documentation for instructions. As an example, here's [how to add a new chain on Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h_01G63GGCJH5GCYDYPH5RNWNZQ8).
            </Step>
            <Step title="Your external wallet isn't detecting the NFT ticket/membership.">
                Please see our instructions [here](/user-guide/managing-wallet/manually-add-nft) on how to manually add an NFT to your wallet.
            </Step>
        </Steps>       
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I can't log into the Moongate Verify mobile application.">
        The Moongate Verify mobile application is intended for event hosts ‚Äì you shouldn't have to use it! As a general user, please instead visit your 
        user portal and tap 'Check in" to check into your event ‚Äì more information on that [here](/user-guide/the-basics/user-check-in-guide).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I get a refund on my purchase?">
        Moongate does not typically support refunds (although refunds may be issued in exceptional cases ‚Äì please refer to the 
        [Refund Policy](/user-guide/refund-policy/refund-policy) for more information). However, you can try to sell your NFT ticket/membership on the secondary market, 
        or [transfer your NFT to someone else](/user-guide/managing-wallet/transferring-nft) via the blockchain.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I transfer my NFTs?">
        The ability to transfer your NFTs depends on the specific terms of the event or membership. Some tokens are "soulbound," meaning they cannot be transferred. 
        However, if the token is not soulbound, you are free to transfer your NFTs as you wish.

        If you have logged in via email and your NFT is stored in the non-custodial wallet we created for you, you can follow the steps below to transfer it back to 
        your own wallet. Please note that if you already have your NFT in your own wallet, you can freely transfer it as usual.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Does my NFT ticket disappear after the event?">
        Most tickets remain as NFTs in your wallet after the event and may even have future utility. However, it is best practice to check the terms and conditions 
        of each event just to be sure.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why do I only receive the receipt email?">
        The email address you provided during the billing process is used to receive the receipt.
        
        On the other hand, the "ticket confirmation" is sent to the email address you provided for the ticket. Please check both email addresses for all relevant information.
