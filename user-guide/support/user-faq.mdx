    <Accordion title="Do I need a blockchain wallet to make a purchase on Moongate?">
        No, you don't!

        When you create a Moongate account via Google or email, Moongate automatically creates a non-custodial wallet for you. You can 
        manage this wallet under the "[Profile](app.moongate.id/profile)" page on our user web portal. Web3 users creating their Moongate 
        account for the first time can link to their existing wallet both during and after the account creation process.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I don't recognise the wallet address at the checkout page.">
        When you log in using Google or email, we automatically create a non-custodial wallet for you. The wallet address that you do not recognize is likely the address of this non-custodial wallet.
        
        If you would prefer to receive the NFT in your own external wallet, you have two options:
        1. Create a new account using your own wallet – more information on that under the 'Existing Wallet' tab [here](/user-guide/the-basics/signup-login).
        2. [Connect your wallet to your existing Moongate account](/user-guide/managing-wallet/connecting-wallet). After connecting your wallet you'll be able to choose your own wallet during check out.
