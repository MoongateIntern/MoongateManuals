description: 'A brief explanation of common web3 terms'

We've taken great care to abstract away most of the complexities of Web3 on Moongate in order to make things easier to understand. In case you're curious though, we've explained some basic Web3 terms below for your reference. Please feel free to skip this section though – you truly don't need to know much about Web3 in order to get the most out of Moongate.


**Blockchain:** think of a blockchain as a very large public spreadsheet.

**NFT:** think of an NFT as a cell in that very large public spreadsheet. That cell can be used to represent anything – pictures, videos, or in Moongate's case, tickets and memberships.

**Minting:** the act of allocating a space on the blockchain to an NFT. Continuing with the above metaphor, minting is declaring the value of a new cell within the public spreadsheet.

**Gas Fee:** the fee paid for making a transaction on the blockchain, including creating an NFT. Don't worry though, Moongate absorbs the gas fee for all campaigns created on our platform!

**Wallet:** part of the information contained within an NFT is a link that lets others know who owns it. If NFTs are PO boxes, then wallets are the address associated with them.

**Token-Gating/Whitelisting:** restricting the ability to own/purchase an NFT to a specific group of users, either via ownership of another specified NFT or other means (email, for instance.)

**Soulbound:** while a regular NFT can be traded between anybody with a crypto wallet, soulbound NFTs cannot be traded.

**Airdrop:** distributing an NFT for free to a specified group of users.
