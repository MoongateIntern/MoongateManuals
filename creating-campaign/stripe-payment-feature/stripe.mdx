<Note>To enable the Stripe feature and connect your account to Moongate's Stripe account, please contact Moongate for permission.</Note>

## What is Stripe Connect?
> Stripe Connect is a service that allows platforms to manage payments on behalf of their users. Here's an example to illustrate how it works:
>
> Imagine you are an event organizer using Moongate to host and manage your events. You want to sell tickets online and receive payments from attendees. Instead of setting up your own payment processing system, you can use Stripe Connect. Moongate, as the platform, handles the payment processing for you. This means:
>
> **Moongate:** Manages the transactions, ensuring payments from ticket sales go through smoothly. <br />
>
> **Organizer (You):** Receives payments from ticket sales directly to your account without having to worry about the complexities of payment processing.
> This allows you to focus on organizing your event while Moongate and Stripe Connect take care of the financial transactions.
