## What is Stripe Connect?
> Stripe Connect is a feature that allows your payments to be sent directly to your account while Moongate handles the associated fees.
>
>
> **User:** Purchases the ticket from Moongate and pays the ticket price along with platform fees.
>
> **Organizer (You):** Receives payments from ticket sales directly to your Stripe account, eliminating the need to request payouts from Moongate. This allows you to focus on organizing your event while Stripe Connect handles the payment processing.
>
> **Platform Fees:** Moongate receives the platform fees automatically
