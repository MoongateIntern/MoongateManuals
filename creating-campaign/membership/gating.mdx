title: 'Gating by NFT/Email/Wallet'
description: 'Limit membership tier purchases to a group of specified users'
---

By gating a membership tier type, vendors can restrict the ability to attain membership to specified people only, allowing vendors to offer exclusive value to users. 

Membership eligibility can be allocated by ownership of certain NFT collections and email/NFT wallet addresses. 
<Info>
    Please note that gating is an optional feature and does not need to be enabled should you not require it.
