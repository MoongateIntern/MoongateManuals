title: 'Gating by NFT/Email/Wallet'
description: 'Limit ticket access to a group of specified users'
---

By gating a ticket type, vendors can restrict the ability to purchase it to specified people only, allowing vendors to offer exclusive value to users. 

Ticket purchase eligibility can be allocated by ownership of certain NFT collections and email/NFT wallet addresses.
<Info>
    Please note that gating is an optional feature and does not need to be enabled should you not require it.

            <Tip>
                A ticket can be gated by multiple NFT collections (i.e a purchaser must own an NFT from **at least one** of the specified collections). Simply click 'Add Collection' and repeat the above process to add an additional collection.

            <Tip>
                Tickets can be gated so that a purchaser must own an NFT from **every** specified collection to unlock it.
