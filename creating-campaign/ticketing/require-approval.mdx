<Info>
> **Standard Operating Procedure for Approval Tickets:**
> 
> 1. When a user purchases a ticket that requires approval, they will receive an email indicating that the ticket is pending.
> 2. NFT airdrop will be pending until approval.
> 3. Organizers can review the ticket in the portal, where they will see options in the "approval" column.
> 4. The organizer can either approve or reject the ticket:
>     - **If Rejected:** A second confirmation will appear, followed by a toast notification. Once confirmed, the user will receive an email informing them of the rejection.
>     - **If Approved:** A double confirmation and toast notification will appear for the organizer. The NFT Ticket will be airdropped to the user's account only after approval.
> 5. When the ticket is approved, the user will receive an email notification confirming their ticket approval and the NFT Ticket will be airdropped to their account. The user can then use the approved ticket for the event.
