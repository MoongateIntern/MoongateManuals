Under traditional models, it is challenging for creators and fans to connect in meaningful ways. This is through no fault of their own, as traditional centralized platforms set the terms of use and interaction, focus solely on purchases, and fail to cultivate a sense of belonging and community amongst creators and fans.

For instance, conventional platforms such as Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, and Lu.ma fully control the data and digital assets issued through their platform, leaving creators and brands with minimal control over their engagement with fans. Additionally, the primary incentive of such platforms is to generate revenue through transactions, further reducing opportunities for meaningful engagement between creators, brands, and fans. In laymanâ€™s terms, the existence of intermediaries with misaligned interests within the creator-fan relationship diminishes the potential of such relationships by siphoning revenue and limiting direct interaction, resulting in a worse experience for both creators and fans.

Moongate aims to place control back into the hands of creators and fans, unlocking their abilities to engage in more direct, meaningful, and value-aligned ways. By enabling the self-sovereign ownership of data and digital assets by creators and fans, a deeper level of engagement between the two can be accomplished.
