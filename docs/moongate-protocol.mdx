title: 'Moongate Protocol'

Moongate is building a modular Web3 engagement layer for real-world activations, aiming to transform the value exchange between creators and fans. We have dubbed this layer the Moongate Protocol.

The Moongate Protocol leverages blockchain technology to transform IRL experiences into on-chain credentials and enable user’s IRL assets to unlock on-chain value, redefining the relationship between creators and fans. The protocol’s foundation is an engagement-focused Layer2 blockchain and AI-powered engine, which is being built for scale, efficiency, and open participation.

Our no-code digital token issuance platform serves as the primary engine of the Moongate Protocol, enabling creators to issue credentials that seamlessly fit into real world use cases. More specifically, creators can utilize the various modules on our no-code platform to issue and integrate programmable digital tokens for use across ticketing, membership, loyalty program, fanclub, and integrated phygital products contexts. 

Creators can then offer various exclusive benefits, access, and rewards within a token-gated community channel to foster a deeper relationship with their fans. For instance, a musician could offer presale tickets, meet-and-greets, and exclusive merch to dedicated token-carrying members of their fan club.

The Moongate Protocol also makes it simple for users to get involved, as they can easily create a Moongate ID as a self-sovereign ‘passport’ even without prior knowledge of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Their passport enables them to curate and collect their omni-channel credentials, allowing them to unlock various on and off-chain access, rewards, and communities.
