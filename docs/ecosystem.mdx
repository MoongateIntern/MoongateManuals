The power and proof of the Moongate protocolâ€™s effectiveness is best demonstrated by our flagship product: a decentralized ticketing platform. Our ticketing platform has already been used for thousands of events, boasts an active user base of more than 100,000 organically onboarded individuals, and is trusted by major enterprise customers including Binance, Avalanche, Wonderfruit, ItsTheShip, Token2049, Siam Piwat, and many more across 30+ countries.

Our no-code platform makes it easy for event organizers to issue and integrate programmable digital tokens, and our seamless end user-facing platform focuses on providing a frictionless onboarding experience, breaking down the Web3 barrier to drive mass adoption even amongst Web2 natives. Discovery, social, and rewards systems further incentivize user/event attendee participation, increasing user engagement, transforming users into passionate brand evangelists, and extending the customer journey well beyond the ticket point of purchase.

We're now focused on growing our ecosystem, expanding beyond ticketing into adjacent verticals such as memberships and integrated products. Part of this growth includes the development of our own engagement-focused Layer2 blockchain, as well as tools for developers to build solutions for issuing and integrating digital tokens in IRL contexts.
